\section{Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment} \label{section:higgs_cms}
The aim of this section is to introduce the LHC Machine and the CMS detector by  briefly reviewing the components that are pertinent to the analysis performed. Very detailed documents outlining the design and architecture of both the CMS and LHC can be found in the CMS Technical Design Report \cite{TDR,CMSExperiment} and LHC machine specification \cite{lhcMachine}.

\subsection{The LHC Machine} \label{subsection:higgs_cms_lhc}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerating and colliding complex located on the border between France and Switzerland. Figure \ref{fig:higgs_cms_lhc} shows the geographical overview of the location of LHC and of several experiments that are currently hosted there: ATLAS \cite{ATLASExperiment}, CMS, LHCb \cite{LHCbExperiment} and ALICE \cite{ALICEExperiment}. Each of these experiments is located at the beam crossing point along the ring.

The main constituent of the LHC is a 27 km circular tunnel located about 100 m underground and equipped with thousands of various superconducting dipole and quadrupole electromagnets. The operating temperature of the collider electromagnets is about -271\textdegree{}C, which is maintained by a special liquid helium based cryogenic system. Superconducting magnets are used to focus the beam along the ring towards the corresponding interaction points.

The LHC beams are structured into individual colliding bunches, with ~10$^{11}$ protons per bunch and time separation of 25 ns, which is the period of the proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In total, it is possible to have at most about 3600 bunches, however only up to 2808 could be filled with protons. The rest, called Abort Gap, are used for the experiment's maintenance, calibration, or other accelerator-related work.

One of the most important characteristics of the collision environment specifically for the analysis is the amount of Pile Up (PU). Typically, it is represented in terms of the number of primary vertices per a given bunch crossing. The importance arises from the fact that simulation has to be properly accommodated by mixing simulated processes with additional Minimum Bias samples (samples which correspond to events with detector occupancies above some known threshold). Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_pu} shows the distribution of the number of primary vertices per event both for simulation and data.

\subsection{The CMS Detector} \label{subsection:higgs_cms_generaldescription}
The Compact Muon Solenoid, one of the two largest experiments hosted at the LHC, is a two-fold creature; first of all, it is a one of its kind general purpose particle detector system, which consists of multiple components and whose primary objective is to record and reconstruct physics events that could help study the fundamental building blocks of nature. It acts like a camera, recording the footprint of the physics interactions which particle physicists use to deduce the underlying physics. The Compact Muon Solenoid is also an experiment, a collaboration of thousands of people whose combined effort made it possible to build and operate such a device. From people involved in data-taking at Point 5 and detector maintenance experts to people performing the analysis of recorded events and making sure that the collected data is of the highest quality - it is one of the best examples when group effort produces results of highest esteem.

The most important component of CMS that makes it stand out among other experiments is the superconducting solenoid with magnetic field of 3.8 T. The magnet is located just outside of the HCAL subsystem and plays a crucial role in the overall architecture of CMS. In particular, due to the strength of magnetic field, significant improvements are expected in the search for the Higgs Boson decaying via two muons due to the high resolution of the muon system together with the power of the magnet. The closest subsystem of CMS to the interaction point is the Silicon Tracker \cite{Tracker}, whose primary objective is to measure the momenta of the charged particles passing through. What follows are Electromagnetic \cite{ECAL} and Hadronic \cite{HCAL} subsystems which respectively consist of several subdetectors with varying performance characteristics. Muon Systems are located just outside of the magnet and comprise different technologies depending on the $\eta$ location \cite{Muon}. In total, there are three different types of gaseous systems used for muon chambers. Drift Tubes (DTs) together with Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are located in the central (Barrel) region, a part of the CMS detector that expects lower occupancy due to the lower particle fluxes. In turn, in the region with higher neutron fluxes, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) are used instead of DTs.

The Large Hadron Collider is not merely a challenging project from an engineering standpoint; it is also a data factory, one of its kind, that presents a unique challenge for the data processing and analysis domains. The amount of data that gets generated quickly becomes unmanageable and one has to be careful when selecting what to preserve and what to abandon. The collision rate is 40 MHz and the compressed size of just one event coming from CMS is on the order of 1 MB. That amounts to 40 TB/s and extrapolating up to a single hour of datataking it is at the order of 140 PB/h - obviously this becomes unfeasible very quickly. For the purpose of selection of events of interest, all HEP Experiments employ a sophisticated Trigger System, whose purpose is to select the physics events of interest. CMS has two layers for event triggering: Level 1 \cite{L1Trigger} and High Level Trigger (HLT) \cite{HLTrigger}. The Level 1 trigger system is a hardware-based processing system that is tightly integrated with the rest of the subsystems' electronics. Level 1 allows CMS to reduce the event rate from 40 MHz down to 100 KHz. This is achieved by applying basic selections at hardware level (integration with the subsystems' electronics results in zero copy processing) using reduced content information known as Trigger Primitives (TPs).

The 100 KHz output of Hardware Trigger System gets further reduced by the High Level Trigger system, down to 1 KHz that gets actually written to disk. This content reduction is achieved by employing high level information produced via the reconstruction procedure. The CMS High Level Trigger System is a reasonable-sized High Performance Cluster (HPC) Complex which takes the output of Level 1 and acts as a filtering farm, preserving only events that should be stored to disk for offline processing. The software framework that gets used is the same one as for offline data analysis; however certain reconstruction steps are optimized for performance.
