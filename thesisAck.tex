% I owe a lifetime of gratitude to Professor Yasar Onel for his support, mentorship, and his inspiration to push myself to be a better person and a better physicist every day.  I, and many others, would not be here if it were not for him.

% I also must also acknowledge the friendship, mentorship, kindness, and support Professor Ugur Akgun has shown me.  He is an inspiration to me as an instructor, a researcher, a husband, and a father, and if it weren't for his support, I would never have dreamed of embarking on this journey.

% I have to thank Professor Vincent Rodgers for accepting me, an \textit{experimental} physicist, into his courses on general relativity and quantum field theory.  These courses gave me profound respect for the combination of mathematics and those with the creativity necessary to see the `real' world.  Time spent in those classes became a major source of inspiration for me to understand the processes of the universe more deeply, leaving an impression that will stay with me for my lifetime.

% Professor Robert Mutel has had a unique and important impact on me, as a scientist, as an instructor, and as a family man during my time at Iowa.  I must thank him for showing me the world of the telescope, and allowing me the opportunity to help shape the astronomy lab courses.  His vision for thinking up crazy ideas and his ability to make them happen has had a \textit{deep impact}, pun intended, on me.

% I have to especially thank my colleagues on the search for a Majorana neutrino.  Professor John Ellison has been an exceptional mentor to me, helping me along, (and being very patient), while I learned the intricacies of performing a CMS analysis.  Dr. Ferdinando Giordano, whose countless FaceTimes, iMessages, and emails during almost all hours of these past days and nights are a testament to his dedication, expertise, and kindness.  Though we have yet to meet face-to-face, we now have a bond that only CERN can create between people.

% I am very thankful to Professor Jane Nachtman for chairing my committee, and accepting me as her student.  I am forever grateful for the amazing opportunity she has given me.

% I offer an infinite number of thank-yous to the University of Iowa's Physics Department staff.  Their professionalism, expertise, and knowledge has been extremely helpful.

% Beyond that, I want to express the highest gratitude to those who have set the standards for the rest of us to meet and to exceed; they are the people who most inspire me.

% Just as important are my family and friends for being there to catch my fall, to get me back up, and to push me to try again; for expecting me to accept challenges, and encouraging me to endlessly try until I succeed.  It has not been easy.

% Lastly, to my dearest Shelly:   I haven't stopped smiling since I met you.
