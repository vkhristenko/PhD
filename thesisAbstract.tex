The search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in proton-proton collisions with the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment is performed. Building on top of the success of previous CMS analyses (CMS Run I campaign), results are presented using 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected over the course of 2016 (CMS Run II campaign) at the center of mass $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.

During the Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) of the Large Hadron Collider, CMS Experiment has undergone substantial hardware changes. Second topic discusses the process of Calibration of the CMS Hadron Forward Calorimeter in preparation for colissions after LS1.

Final chapter discusses the process of bulding simulations of calorimeter systems. We will walk through all the steps from geometry specification to readout definition and present the results for two standalone calorimeters that have been proposed as potential replacements for respective CMS components.
