A search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson decaying to two muons in proton-proton collisions with the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment is performed. Building on top of the success of previous CMS analyses (CMS Run I campaign), results are presented using 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected over the course of 2016 (CMS Run II campaign) at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.

During the Long Shutdown 1 of the Large Hadron Collider, the CMS detector underwent substantial hardware changes. The second topic discusses the process of calibration of the CMS Hadron Forward Calorimeter in preparation for collisions after LS1.

The final chapter discusses the process of building simulations of calorimeter systems. Walking through all the steps from geometry specification to readout definition the results for two standalone calorimeters are presented that have been proposed as potential replacements for respective CMS components.
