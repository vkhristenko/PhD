\section{Description of the HF Calorimeters}

The HF calorimeters in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) cover a large pseudorapidity
range, $3 \le |\eta| \le 5$, and thus significantly improve jet detection and the missing transverse energy resolution which are essential in top quark production studies, Standard Model Higgs, and all SUSY particle searches~\cite{CMSTP:1994,CMSTP:1997}.

CMS has two hadronic forward calorimeters, HF- and HF+, each being a hollow cylindrical steel structure with an inner radius of 12.5 cm (to accommodate the beam pipe) and an outer radius of 130.0 cm with the front face located 11.15 m from the center of CMS. Both calorimeters are wrapped by hermetic radiation shielding of 40 cm thick steel, 40 cm of concrete, and 5 cm of polyethylene, with a large steel plug in the back of each detector.

Figure~\ref{fig:hf_description_crosssectionview} displays the cross sectional view of HF calorimeter. Each HF side is azimuthally subdivided into $18$ $20\degree$ wedges composed of 5 mm thick grooved steel plates that perform as absorbers. The plate grooves run parallel to the beam line and are spaced 5.0 $\pm$ 0.1 mm center-to-center, each housing a single optical fiber. Each fiber consists of fused-silica, also referred to as quartz, core of \SI{600}{\micro\metre} diameter, layered to an outer diameter of \SI{630}{\micro\metre} with polymer hard-clad, and surrounded to a final diameter of \SI{800}{\micro\metre} with protective acrylate buffer. Each wedge's fibers are bundled to form 24 towers, each with 0.175 x 0.175 ($\Delta\eta$ x $\Delta\phi$) angular span, with exception in angular span for the 2 towers formed closest to the beam pipe. The bundled fibers are held in ferrules that illuminate one end of air-core light guides penetrating shielding of steel, lead, and polyethylene necessary for the readout boxes. The air-core light guides are hollow tubes inlined with highly reflective metal-coated sheets and are coupled to photomultiplier tubes. During LS1 R7525 PMTs were replaced by Hamamatsu R7600 PMTs.

Cherenkov light forms the signal from charged shower particles above the Cherenkov threshold (E $\ge$ 190 KeV for electrons), optimizing the HF calorimeter's sensitivity to the electromagnetic component of showers~\cite{Akchurin:2955}. Light incident upon the core-cladding interface above the critical angle ($71\degree$) contributes to the signal, although a small fraction of light is captured in the numerical aperture (NA = 0.33 $\pm$ 0.02) and only half reaches the PMT photocathode. Since the calorimeter is most sensitive to the electromagnetic component of showers, two different lengths of optical fibers are inserted into the absorbers and connected to separate PMTs. Half of all fibers in each calorimeter tower extend the full depth of the absorber (165 cm $\approx$ 10 $\lambda_I$), while the other half starts 22 cm from the front end. These depths are chosen because a large fraction of energy from electrons or photons are deposited within the first 22 cm of the absorber's front end, while energy from hadronic showers can be deposited throughout the absorber. The naming convention for these two depths of fibers is EM (or L) for the long fibers collecting the total signal and H (or S) for the short fibers collecting the signal from beyond the first 22 cm. Therefore, with 24 towers per wedge
and 2 PMTs per tower, a single readout box housing 24 PMTs services half a wedge ($10\degree$).

In order to uniformly collect data throughout each wedge between EM and H fiber bundles, each absorber groove is filled with alternating EM and H fibers. For the purpose of calibrating the energy readout from the calorimeter, a groove in the center of each tower has its corresponding EM or H fiber replaced with a hollow 15 gauge stainless steel tube with inner and outer diameters of 0.97 mm and 1.32 mm, respectively, referred to as a source tube. Due to the geometry and  varying dimensions of certain towers, there can be more than one groove housing a source tube in order to calibrate sufficiently, especially for higher $\eta$ towers.

Figure~\ref{fig:hf_description_wedgediagram} displays the transverse segmentation of a single wedge with all 24 towers and 31 source tubes. It can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:hf_description_wedgediagram} that the geometry of each tower changes significantly between high $\eta$ index and low $\eta$ index; therefore, it is expected that the energy deposited into each tower by the passing radioactive source varies.

The radioactive source excites a small region of the absorber within its immediate vicinity - 90\% of the signal output originates from a region within 3 cm of the source, with the closest optical fibers to the source contributing  most of the output. When performing radioactive source calibration, each tower is analyzed separately. Therefore, geometric correction factors must be applied to the signal output from each tower to account for the energy that escapes into neighboring towers. Monte Carlo techniques are used to account both for the energy leakage of a given tower as well as the relative position of the source tube with respect to the optical fibers (the source tubes replaced
either an EM or H type optical fiber). Table~\ref{tab:hf_description_gcfactors} lists the geometric correction factors for each tower's energy containment with respect to the type of optical fiber and the source tube replaced.
