\section{Conclusions} \label{section:higgs_conclusions}
In this chapter, a search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in a dimuon final state has been discussed. Data collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV over the course of 2016 Run II datataking campaign has been used and corresponds to the integrrated luminosity of $35.9\pm0.9$ fb$^{-1}$. The observed upper limit on the rate of production of a Higgs Boson has been set for a [120, 130] GeV mass range. For the 125 GeV Higgs Boson, the observed (expected) limit is 2.77 ($2.02^{+0.85}_{-0.58}$) $\times$ SM for 13 TeV. This corresponds to the observed limit of $0.0006$ on $\mathcal{B}(\Htomm)$ for 125 GeV Higgs Boson.

In comparison with Run I results, where the combined observed (expected) limit for the 7 and 8 TeV data was found to be 7.4 ($6.5^{+2.8}_{-1.9}$) \times SM, \cite{}, the search presented in this chapter demonstrates more than a factor of two improvement in the 95\% CL upper limit. New results allow to further constrain fundamental parameters of the Standard Model.

% Results are presented from a search for the SM Higgs boson decaying to $\mu^+\mu^-$. Data from proton-proton
% collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV were recorded in 2016 with the CMS detector and correspond
% % to an integrated luminosity of $35.9\pm0.9$~fb$^{-1}$.

% This search sets upper limits on the ratio of the observed cross-section and the SM predicted cross-section
% at the 95\% confidence level, and produces $p$-values for the background only hypothesis. These results are
% obtained by fitting the background contribution directly in data and estimating the signal contribution from
% Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for a Higgs mass between 120 and 130~\GeVcc.

% The observed (expected) limit on the rate of production of a Higgs boson with the mass of
% 125~\GeVcc is x.xx ($1.98^{+0.81}_{-0.57}$) $\times$ SM for 13 TeV.
% The combined expected limit for 7, 8 and 13 TeV is $x.xx^{+x.xx}_{-x.xx}$ $\times$ SM, while the observed limit
% is x.x $\times$ SM.

% For the CMS measured Higgs mass of 125~\GeVcc, a signal strength
% of $\sigma/\sigma_{SM}=x.xx^{+x.xx}_{-x.xx}$ is observed.

% These are the best results to date on the Higgs coupling to second fermion generation.
