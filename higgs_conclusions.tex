\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

Results are presented from a search for the SM Higgs boson decaying to $\mu^+\mu^-$. Data from proton-proton
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV were recorded in 2016 with the CMS detector and correspond
to an integrated luminosity of $35.9\pm0.9$~fb$^{-1}$.

This search sets upper limits on the ratio of the observed cross-section and the SM predicted cross-section
at the 95\% confidence level, and produces $p$-values for the background only hypothesis. These results are
obtained by fitting the background contribution directly in data and estimating the signal contribution from
Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for a Higgs mass between 120 and 130~\GeVcc.

The observed (expected) limit on the rate of production of a Higgs boson with the mass of
125~\GeVcc is x.xx ($1.98^{+0.81}_{-0.57}$) $\times$ SM for 13 TeV.
The combined expected limit for 7, 8 and 13 TeV is $x.xx^{+x.xx}_{-x.xx}$ $\times$ SM, while the observed limit
is x.x $\times$ SM.

For the CMS measured Higgs mass of 125~\GeVcc, a signal strength
of $\sigma/\sigma_{SM}=x.xx^{+x.xx}_{-x.xx}$ is observed.

These are the best results to date on the Higgs coupling to second fermion generation.
