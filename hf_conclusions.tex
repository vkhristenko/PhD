\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter we presented the results of the Hadron Forward calorimeter sourcing calibration procedure after new PMTs were installed on HF. Sourcing data was collected prior to installing the new PMTs in HF- in order to obtain the average source energy deposition and extrapolate over both HF calorimeters. Calibration coefficients (HF Gains) were computed by averaging the background-subtracted signal yield over the majority of the absorber depth (beyond 30cm of each end of the source tube) for a given tower of each wedge and uploaded to the CondDB (Conditions DataBase) for further use. Systematic uncertainties have been calculated and estimated to be under 10\%, which agrees with the expected precision for our calibration procedure.
