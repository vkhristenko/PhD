\section{Introduction and Motivation}
During the First Long Shutdown (LS1) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), Hadron Forward (HF) Calorimeters have undergone substantial hardware upgrade: the
new HF Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) have been installed and the part of the readout electronics has been replaced. Therefore, the detector had to be recommissioned in preparation for the Run II datataking campaign. In order to establish the Calibration Coefficients (CCs) for the HF Calorimeter with the new PMTs, three sourcing campaigns have been performed: HF- October 2013, HF+ April 2014, and HF- July 2014.

In this chapter the procedure and results of the performed calibration are presented.

% In this paper, we specifically concentrate on
% discussing the results of HF Source Calibration. In Section 2, a brief description of HF
% calorimeter is presented. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the
% calibration workflow, including the description of the source driver system and
% HF Data Acquisition System (DAQ). In this section we also provide a description of all Sourcing Campaigns and outline issues experienced during the data taking. In Section 4, we thoroughly outline the analysis procedure used, and then the results of each sourcing campaign performed
% during the LS1 are presented in the Section 5, Finally, we conclude summarizing the results of Sourcing Campaign during LS1.
